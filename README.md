# k-Tape Turing Machine Visualizer

An interactive web app to explore **deterministic and nondeterministic k-tape Turing machines**. It renders the **state graph**, the **configuration graph** (reachable configurations with tape contents and head positions), and the **unfolded computation tree**. You can step through runs, branch manually on nondeterminism, and switch between compact and detailed views.

## Features
- k-tape machines (deterministic & nondeterministic)
- YAML input format
- Live execution with step/auto-run and manual branching on nondeterministic choices
- Visualizations:
  - **State graph**
  - **Configuration graph** with incremental expansion
  - **Computation tree** with optional path compression
- Two node styles: **Circles** and **Cards**
- Editor with schema validation

## Quick Start (Local)
